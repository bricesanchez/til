# Today Icelab Learned

A knowledgebase of little learnings from the team at [Icelab](http://icelab.com.au/).

## Contributing

1. Open a new pull request against this repository (using a feature branch).
2. Add a markdown file with your learnings to one of the topic directories under `content/` (or create a new one if the appropriate topic is missing).
3. Add YAML front-matter for the post's `title`, publishing `date`, and your name as `author`.
4. Short is sweet. Your learning doesn't need to be lengthy. A few sentences and some example code is enough. The markdown is parsed as [GFM](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/) so you can used fenced code-blocks with syntax highlighting.

## Building the site

The site is _(well, will be)_ built automatically when new posts are merged into the `master` branch.

The site is built using [Metalsmith](http://www.metalsmith.io). Run `make` to build it locally.
