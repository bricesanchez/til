[ChromeVox](http://www.chromevox.com/) is a screen reader extension for Chrome.

I found it a helpful extension when working on fixing accessibility issues on the [State of Service website](http://stateoftheservice.apsc.gov.au/). I was able to replicate the voice prompts noted in the accessibility audit. Thus, fixing them was much easier!

One thing to note is that you'll want to change the default voice. The default just seems to cackle at you. You can do this via `Settings > Extensions > ChromeVox > Options`.
