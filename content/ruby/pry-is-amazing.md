[Pry](https://github.com/pry/pry) is amazing! It has a whole bunch of helpful shortcuts you can use while working in a session.

I found the [exception handling shortcuts](https://github.com/pry/pry/wiki/Exceptions) particularly helpful. `_ex_` will give you the last raised exception, and `wtf?` will show you a stacktrace from that exception (which is helpful, since stacktraces aren't normally shown in interactive terminal sessions like this). Hilariously, you can add more question marks or exclamation marks on the end to see more detail.

If you work with Ruby app consoles regularly, you'd do yourself a favour to give the [Pry Wiki](https://github.com/pry/pry/wiki) a good read!
